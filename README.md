# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Mukhammadlatif Latipov

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about learrning about my tool Firebase to gain knowledge of JavaScript. The purpose of this blog is to create an website of countdown app.

## Content
For my project, I am making a countdown web browser where you can see it in real time anywhere of how much time left before something like ex: how much minutes, hours, days weeks, months left before you have a trip. . This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Firebase in order to make a countdown app.

## Implications
This idea could be used to benefit society as a whole by making it easier to know how much time is remaining before an event. Of course, there are numerous methods to measure time using a calendar app or a clock, but there are numerous ways in which a countdown app could be valuable in our culture, especially as technology advances. There may already be numerous countdown websites online, but I tried to make one myself that could be just as useful and that I could control and tweak whatever I wanted. The advantage would be that I would not have to pay anything because when you download any app, you are asked to pay for a membership or you would be spammed with advertisements.
