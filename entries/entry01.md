# Entry 1 Learning/Planning for the project.
##### 11/8/21

During this year I will be learning about a tool of a computer engineering Firebase. [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications to store data. I will be using this tool to make an app that will store a time, date, month and year in real time to keep track of what is going on. I have decided to use Firebase because I believe it is very helpful for my web application to store data inside. With my JavaScript knowledge, I will be gathering info on how to use the Firebase app as well as taking notes on what I learned. 

As far as I can tell, I am pretty good at math and my project will require tremendous math problems that I will be facing, so as a result one of my skills is that I am proficient at math. Another skill I have is keeping track of time on what I will be doing and planning everything before I do the problem. Overall for skills the most important thing I learned was don't be afraid or to hesitate to ask any questions about anything that I think is important. For now I will learn more about the JavaScript and the languages of Firebase, then I will put the best of us to create a proper blueprint to then test it then we will make corrections that we put out the best we can provide from myself.

For the [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) I am currently in **step 1** since I am in the process of finding, and defining my problem. Additionally, I am in the process where I will be learning about my tool [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) which would take most of my time going through this Freedom Project. As a whole class, we are still learning/gaining knowledge of Javascript from [FCC](freecodecamp.org/learn) and knowledge from SEP class. My plan for the next process is to first have an idea of what I should be doing first, such as planning my things on specific days to stay organized.
