At the moment, I have finally finished my MVP(Minimum Valuable Project). The minimum thing for my project was that I had to have a countdown web app where it saves the user info through firebase including the event name.

As you click the link below, it brings you to the jsbin where I inserted the full javascript code that I wrote by myself to store in the firebase. It also includes all the comments on specific lines in order to keep track what each line represents for. To make it short, the javascript includes a if statement, objects, functions, event listener(button), arrays to save in the firebase as well as strings and finally a merge function where it takes all the info and sends it to the firebase.

## **EDP**
I would say that I am in stage 7 and 8 of [Engineering Design Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anCzhzfZUNXD713Z1PqBDSAO_tU2PbZUpvT6zi3Y0jQ/preview) since I have done all the minimum valuable project and test out all the functions. There are many things to improve in my project such as the design of the website where how it would look on the mobile devices as well as other screen sizes. Also with description of my website where I add all the useful things on what things will be stored and gathered from user. Lastly, I am at the part where I will communicate the result because everything is done and I would need to explain and see what people would think of it.

## **Skills**

This Freedom Project finally led to the development of various new abilities in me. In particular, I've learned a lot about personal organization management. These two abilities are extremely beneficial and necessary. My personal management skills have improved. While working on my task, I learned not to let anything to enter my head. I find that browsing the material or instructions first, then taking a break before returning to it, works best for me. This is quite beneficial to me since it is more reasonable than wasting energy trying to comprehend something that my mind cannot fathom. I've started using comments as notes to help me organize things a lot better than before, and it's helped me a lot.
