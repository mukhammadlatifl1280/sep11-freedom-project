# Entry 2
##### 12/19/21

During the past few weeks I have gained some knowledge of learning my tool [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). I have visited several links on how to use the tool for beginners. For example I have searched specifically "how to use firebase console" then I visited this [website](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase#:~:text=Log%20in%20to%20the%20Firebase,Click%20Add%20Firebase.). This brought me to the firebase official web page and I scrolled through to read and how to use it. There were 3 steps on how to use it but I had no idea how to follow the steps. Therefore, I searched for a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag&skip_registered_account_check=true) tutorial for the steps. The video explained thoroughly on the basic steps on how to use it. After trying many steps, I finally managed to open the console. Additionally, I used `npm install firebase` to install Firebase to my IDE which will help me program my project using my [IDE](https://ide.cs50.io). During the process of installing the firebase I noticed I downloaded several files into my IDE which was very overwhelming because I didn't understand what they meant.

Since the last blog I have gained two major skills. During this past week, the skill I gained was that I got better at researching what I am looking for. I think I am proficient at researching on my tool since I discovered many things about Firebase just by watching youtube videos, visiting links to tutorials etc. Another skill that I have learned and got advanced on is time management. For example I used only about 3-4 hours in this Blog Entry 2 to finish this assignment and I think this time is enough to do this assignment. This skill also allowed me to save time in the future since I did this assignment in the evening and every evening I have time to do my research..

I believe I am in step 2 of [Engineering Design Process](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) because in step 2 it states "Research the problem" which I clearly researched about my tool during the past few weeks. I am confident that in the next stage I am ready to brainstorm more ideas for my tool as well as testing my tool. When the winter break comes ahead, I am looking forward to researching more and brainstorming questions to myself on how to use the tool.
