Currently, I am in the middle of processing my freedom project and creating my prototype of my project which is collecting user data and making a personal account for every user by using document ID. After returning to Firebase, I gained a better knowledge of the tool and was able to develop something basic but powerful. In terms of my sources, I went over the firebase documentation once more, but this time I focused on how to [add data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data) in the Firestore and [get data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data) in the HTML.

As from now on I have managed to create a single user document page as like "register section". I have used all the documentation from the firestore above and use examples to make it possible.

In the image below that is my finale code for creating user name and document ID and adding to the firebase.

In the chunks of code above, it explains all the details for what each line of the code means. In short, all the chunk of code above is for getting user data which is only their name but as for document ID, the computer generates for them. The main reason why I wanted the computer to generate the ID for the user is because I dont want users to store their password in the Firestore database. However, I could have used Authentication method for users to sign in, but I didn't want to use two methods in once so I decided to use only firestore in my project.

Next to that code below it, its a screenshot of the firestore database where whenever the user creates a account it will generate their user ID in the "**users**" section. On the next section, it is where all the information is stored such as their name and eventName and the countdown numbers as for my example.


## **EDP**

I would say that I am in stage 5 and 6 of [Engineering Design Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anCzhzfZUNXD713Z1PqBDSAO_tU2PbZUpvT6zi3Y0jQ/preview) since I have an idea on how to save user data in the firebase and get data from it. I am also at the part where I am creating the prototype because I am using all my plan that I made in the past and putting it in the prototype. As I am coding, I keep testing my code constantly because this is my first time learning this specific tool and getting the hang of it.

## **Skills**

The Freedom Project eventually inspired me several new skills. I've learnt a lot about personal organization management in particular. These two skills are incredibly useful and crucial. My personal management abilities have strengthened. I learnt not to let anything into my mind while working on my assignment. Whatever works best for me is to browse the documentation or instruction, then take a break until resuming to it. This is very useful to me since it is more logical than losing energy attempting to comprehend something that my thoughts cannot understand. I've been utilizing comments as notes to help me arrange things lot better than before, and it's helped me organize stuff much better than before.
