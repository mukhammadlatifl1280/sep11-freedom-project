## Content

Following the completion of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), my classmates and I encouraged to go beyond the MVP. I attempted to create a shareable countdown link for my project but was unsuccessful. The only thing I modified was the CSS, in which I updated the color scheme based on ideas from my classmates. Following the Beyond MVP, my friends and I visited a SEP expo on May 17th, where we delivered a presentation to the judges about our year-long project. Finally, we each presented our project to our class and teacher individually, explaining how we processed our assignment and learnt our tool.

It was difficult for me to be prepared during this time since I didn't have enough time to practice presenting, and as a result, I delivered a poor presentation of my product. According to the judges, I obtained the highest mark I could on the basis of creativity, a 4/4. This demonstrates that my creativity skills are expert, and there are few areas where I can develop. Unfortunately, my presentation received a 3.5/4, indicating that there is still space for improvement. I believe I would need to stand up and present since I recall sitting on the table and presenting and taking a little too long. Because of this, I have learned my lesson and do better next time which is in my senior year.

Because I received a higher mark, I appeared to present better in this section of the presentation than in the expo presentation. There are many areas in which I might enhance my presentation, but I have also accomplished more positive outcomes. In terms of the positive aspects, I believe I did a decent job of describing my code and method, as well as using visuals, but I need to work on my hook and conclusion. As a consequence of this presentation, I believe I have learnt many valuable lessons from the Freedom Project, which was both demanding and difficult.

## Engineering Design Process [(**EDP**)](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp)

I'd say I'm on step 8 of the EDP, which is to communicate the results. I completed all of the previous levels and was successful. To communicate the result, I'd have to show all of my product's results as well as how I went about learning Firebase. There are numerous ways to enhance my project, however since I committed major errors, I was able to learn from them. Overall, I would say that the next time I am on this platform, I will not make the same mistakes and will do better.

This Freedom Project eventually resulted in the development of a number of new skills in me. I've learnt a lot about personal organization management in general. These skills are incredibly useful and essential. My presenting abilities, as well as my personal management skills, have improved. I learnt not to allow anything into my brain while focused on my assignment. It works best for me to browse the material or instructions first, then take a break before returning to it. I've learnt that when giving a presentation, I should be more enthusiastic, modest, and maintain eye contact. I've learnt that making eye contact is a sign of confidence when giving a presentation, and as a result, I've learned to do so.
